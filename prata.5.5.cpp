//You sell the book C++ for Fools.Write a program that has you enter a yearâ€™s worth
//of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money).The program should
//use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of
//string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input
//data in an array of int .Then, the program should find the sum of the array con-
//tents and report the total sales for the year.
